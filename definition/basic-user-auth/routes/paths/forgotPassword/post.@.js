When a user forgets their login credentials, they initiate a password reset flow, which sends
a single-use secret token (as part of a link) to their account email address. Access to this
token verifies ownership of the email address.

This \`POST\` request should create a \`password-reset-request\` object in the database, associated
with the user of that username/email, and sends an email to that address, if the user exists.

To finalize the password reset, see the \`PATCH /forgotPassword\` request.
